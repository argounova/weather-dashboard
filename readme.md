# WEEKLY WEATHER DASHBOARD

## Description

Browser based application featuring a 5-day forecast, current weather and saved search history.

- The motivation behind the project was to cleanly incorporate a third-party API, client-side storage and a simple Bootstrap framework.
- This application allows the user to check the current and forecasted weather quickly from their desktop computer.
- Learned topics include parsing third-party data, JavaScript date and time functionality and further cementing an understanding of Bootstrap.
